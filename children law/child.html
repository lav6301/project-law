            <h3>CHILDREN PROTECTION LAW</h3><br>
            <p>The Child Protection Act in India is a set of acts, laws, and rules to ensure the 
                complete protection of children from being exploited. It involves The Juvenile Justice Act, Child Labor Prohibition Act, Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, The Immoral Traffic
                 Prevention Act, Pre-Conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, and Right to Free and 
                 Compulsory Education Act.<br>
                <h2>Child Labor Prohibition Act</h2> 
                 The act prohibits children from engaging in specific employment activities and regulates children’s work conditions. It is an act to stop the child’s abuse. As per this act, a child below the age of 14 should not be engaged in any type of harmful employment.
                 
                <h2>Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act</h2> 
                 Protection of Children From Sexual Offences law of 2012 is one of the most progressive acts of the Government aimed at combating sexual abuse and exploitation of minors. This act classifies sexual assault on a child below 12 years as a punishable crime.
                 
                <h2> Prohibition of Child Marriage Act</h2>
                 This law outlines the minimum age for children to go through marriage and makes it an offense to get them married before the legal age. The last amendment of the Child Marriage Act was passed in 2021, according to which the minimum marriage age for women and men is restricted to 21 years ( prior, it was 18 for women).
                <h2> The Immoral Traffic Prevention Act</h2>
                 This act aims to limit and eventually abolish prostitution in India by criminalizing different forms of sex work. According to the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, any individual or group who will be found guilty of managing or keeping or assisting or acts of the brothel, shall be imprisoned for not less than 1 year and not more than 3 years and shall be charged a said amount of fine.
                 
                <h2> Pre-Conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act</h2>
                 This act intends to ban pre-natal sex determination and related techniques. The goal of the law is to take control of the declining male/female ratio resulting from female foeticide.
                 
                 <h2>Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act</h2>
                 This law describes the significance of free and compulsory education for 
                 children aged 6-14 in the country. The right to quality education is now 
                 considered to be one of the fundamental rights of Indian citizens.
                 
                 The Child Protection Laws In India is a notable effort by the Government to raise more 
                 awareness about children’s rights, safety, and security. While millions of children still
                  face risks, India is improving its awareness of violence, particularly sexual abuse.</p>
