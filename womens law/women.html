            <h3>WOMENS LAW</h3><br>
            <p> women's rights and laws are aimed at ensuring gender equality and addressing 
                issues like discrimination and violence. The primary legislation for women's rights 
                is the "Protection of Women from 
                Domestic Violence Act, 2005," which safeguards women from various 
                forms of abuse within the household.<br><br>
                The purpose of women's laws in India is to empower women, promote their well-being, and create
                 a more equitable society. These laws address issues such as domestic 
                violence, dowry harassment, workplace harassment (Vishaka Guidelines), 
                and provide for women's inheritance rights.<br><br>
                 For common people, these laws serve as a legal framework to seek justice and protection in case of violations.
                They offer avenues for reporting and redressal, ensuring that women have legal recourse against various forms of discrimination and violence. Additionally, there are laws 
                like the Maternity Benefit Act and Equal Remuneration Act that focus on workplace rights and pay equity for women.</p>
